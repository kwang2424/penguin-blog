# On James Reimer

Honestly, I've said that I've wanted to make a blog for the longest time now. Even from the beginning,
I thought it would just be cool to have a platform where I can put my thoughts to writing, especially
about things that I've read or watched. But now that I am writing my thoughts out, they are much less clear
than I initially thought they were. 

Also, since I am currently a CS student in college, I am trying to find projects / ways to learn and
further develop my skills. Everyone always gives the same advice: make projects that you're interested in!
But, it's hard to find and commit to these projects, and also they usually require some knowledge of the
technology / language beforehand. So, I figured writing my blog would be a good project, and a good way
to build my web development skills - specifically React/Next.js/MongoDB. 

So, I hope by the end of this I will have a better handle on my frontend (and to some extend) backend skills.
Right now for most things I have to google, especially with Mongo and React (both in my class/for this project).
Eventually, with more practice I will be confident and not need to google every small little detail. 

In fact, that was something that I wanted to improve on for myself. I realized that in college my skillset
was so incredibly broad and shallow. I knew the basics of many things/subjects from my classes, like languages
or specifically concepts, but I never really had a strong understanding of it because I didn't take the
extra time to get deeper in each topic. I think, for me, I have always been a person with multiple 
interests. In some sense I was spread too thin. but unwilling to commit to learning one specific thing. So,
I ended up not doing anything.

It's been like this for a while for me, and it's still a huge issue. But, by doing projects like these, it gives
me an outlet to get deeper in a specific interest of mine (web development). At the same time, having a blog
allows me to write more. Writing about a certain topic is a good way to learn because writing allows you to
put your cloudy thoughts into a clear summarized essay/post.
